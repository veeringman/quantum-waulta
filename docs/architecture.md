# Waulta Product & Project Architecture

> This document describes the end-to-end architecture of **Waulta** (‚ÄúQuantum Waulta‚Äù), covering both software and hardware components for a fully offline-capable, open-source setup.

---

## üìê Overview

Waulta is a hardware-wallet solution based on an ESP32 microcontroller paired with an ATECC608A crypto co-processor. All core wallet logic (BIP32 key derivation, PSBT parsing/signing, device I/O) lives in a single Rust crate (`waulta-core`). Four ‚Äúthick‚Äù client applications (CLI, Desktop, Mobile, Web WASM) link directly against `waulta-core`, eliminating the need for any backend.

- **waulta-core**: shared Rust library providing:
  - BIP32 (HD wallets)  
  - PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions)  
  - Crypto-chip interface (wake, sign, derive)  
- **CLI App**: Terminal tool for scripting, backups, batch signing  
- **Desktop App**: Rust GUI (Tauri / egui / Slint)  
- **Mobile App**: Rust mobile UI (Dioxus Mobile / Slint)  
- **Web (WASM)**: Browser-based SPA loading `waulta-core` via WebAssembly

- **ESP32** runs FreeRTOS (or async Rust) with Secure Boot & Flash Encryption enabled.  
- **ATECC608A** handles all private-key operations: secure storage, ECDSA signing, BIP32 derivation, RNG.  
- **UI Layer** provides address display, transaction review, and user confirmation via buttons.  
- **Host Communication** uses USB CDC-ACM or BLE GATT to transport PSBTs/APDUs to/from clients.
